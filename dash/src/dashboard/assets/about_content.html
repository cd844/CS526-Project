<h4>
Github is one of the most popular online platforms for hosting code and managing software projects. 
Its ubiquity has also led it to play a major role in displaying the skills of software developers by providing a standard place to host their own code. 
Students and developers often make use of this platform to save and upload their projects and view code from other users. 
<br>
<br>
There are over 200 million repositories hosted on Github as of 2022, and while Github has a search function and API, its lack of search options and throttling of API respectively makes it difficult both to search for repositories beyond by name or to look at trends on the platform as a whole.
Our app uses pre-scraped data to avoid the API limitations for users and helps users search for repositories based on topics or languages of interest. 
We incorporate interactive visual techniques to both search for the most interesting repositories, which we quantify by number of watchers, and use plotting techniques to show how repositories compare to each other based on attributes like size or number of forks.
<br>
<br>
Additionally we provide a framework to compare the languages across searched repositories through violin and timeseries plots, and a simple top 10 list of repositories based on the user search parameters. The timeseries plot can also be used to brush for a specific time range
which is then reflected in the violin plot.
